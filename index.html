		<p>Item #110: "Recent public personalities have been known to fake a Time magazine cover, which is terribly vain... but admittedly makes for great promotion. Jump on the bandwagon and award someone you admire a Person of the Year cover! Create a replica of Person of the Year Time cover shot of your friend or loved one, captioned with one thing that they have done that makes them remarkable or unique. It can be broadly significant, like “She selflessly teaches dozens of children each year!” or it can be subtle “best tooth flosser in America”. When you’re done, tweet it to @time with #GISHPersonOfTheYear</p>
